# Inventory Server
## Brigham Young University
### CSR for the College of Fine Arts and Communications

This repo is for a server to implement an inventory system for our office.  This is the server portion of the inventory system.
It will implement an SQL database to make tables for current inventory, checked out inventory, and a history inventory.  The 
intial implementation is planned to be built for an android client.  Further implementation may include an iOS and web client.
